          Elden Ring is a dark fantasy action role-playing game (RPG) by
          FromSoftware, creators of the wildly popular Dark Souls series. It
          quickly shot to the top of many “most anticipated” lists upon reveal
          at E3 2019, mainly due to Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin’s
          involvement. Yup, instead of finishing The Winds of Winter and A Dream
          of Spring, Martin went off to work on video games for a bit — much to
          the chagrin of book nerds everywhere.

        <p>
          One thing the base game of Elden Ring doesn't allow for though, is a
          player wielding three swords at once. It is largely unusual for
          warriors to have a third sword hanging from their mouths as they enter
          combat, but for One Piece fans, that third blade is a mark of one of
          the strongest characters in the series. Zoro is a fan favorite One
          Piece character, being the first official crew mate to join Luffy in
          his search to become Pirate King. Zoro is often looking for ways to
          train and improve his strength, so one Elden Ring modder has given the
          character the chance to do just that by taking on the bosses of the
          game.
